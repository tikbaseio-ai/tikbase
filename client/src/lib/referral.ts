/**
 * Referral attribution, vendor-neutral.
 *
 * An affiliate link lands on `/?via=jane` (Rewardful's default) or `?ref=jane`
 * (most of the others). The click and the signup are minutes and several page
 * loads apart, and the hash router rewrites the URL on the way, so the code has
 * to be captured the moment it arrives and carried in storage until there is a
 * user to attach it to.
 *
 * Deliberately not tied to a vendor: nothing here calls Rewardful, Tolt or
 * PartnerStack. It captures the code, survives the journey, and writes it to
 * `user_metadata.referral` at signup, where any of them can read it. Picking
 * the vendor is a dashboard decision — see docs/AFFILIATE-SETUP.md.
