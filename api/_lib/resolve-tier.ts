// Lives under api/_lib, not shared/, and that is load-bearing.
//
// @vercel/node compiles each api/*.ts to api/*.js WITHOUT bundling its local
// imports, so an import of '../shared/resolve-tier' survived into the deployed
// function as a bare specifier pointing at a directory Vercel never shipped.
// Every endpoint that imported it died on cold start, in production, for days:
//
//   Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/var/task/shared/resolve-tier'
//     imported from /var/task/api/brand-profile.js
//
// Files under api/ are compiled and shipped; a leading underscore keeps this
// directory from being routed as functions. Imports of it carry an explicit
// .js extension because the deployed importer is ESM and Node will not guess.

/**
 * resolve-tier.ts — server-side entitlement gate.
 *
 * Lifted verbatim from api/top-products.ts so the two 1c endpoints do not become
 * the fourth and fifth copy of a security-relevant function. Behaviour is
 * identical, deliberately:
 *   - the tier comes from the caller's Bearer token, never from a query param,
 *   - NO Stripe calls on the data path (app_metadata is the source of truth),
 *   - any missing/invalid token or lookup failure degrades to 'free'. A data
 *     request is never 401'd; it is answered with the free slice.
 *
 * The three shipped endpoints (top-products, top-creators, check-subscription)
 * still carry their own copies. Migrating them is mechanical but touches live
 * paid-gating, so it is left as a follow-up rather than bundled into a feature
 * PR.
